# PanPack Template
Like the previous template pack, this is a simple "pack" meant to save you time. This time, it's geared more towards pack developers, using my style of folder organization as well as containing Monifactory's Development Tools (build tools, autolint, workspace, etc.) to aid in pack development.

To set up, all you need to do is follow [Monifactory setup instructions](https://github.com/ThePansmith/Monifactory/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#setting-up-an-instance-repository-for-use-in-dev), but using your instance and this repository instead.
To publish to CF, you just need to add your [`CF_PROJECT_ID`](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf1eb689-ced9-475f-9cdc-f044699f3c2d) as a [variable](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/69edf220-b1e8-4e71-aa2c-f43b4a302fef), and a [`RELEASE_TOKEN`](https://authors-old.curseforge.com/account/api-tokens) and a [`API_TOKEN`](https://support.curseforge.com/en/support/solutions/articles/9000208346-about-the-curseforge-api-and-how-to-apply-for-a-key#key) as secrets.
